" Women in Data Science (WiDS) Worldwide is on a mission to increase participation of women in data science to benefit societies worldwide.

Healthcare inequity is a global challenge. Addressing this challenge has an extensive positive impact on women’s health, which is key for societies and economies to thrive. This datathon is designed to help you discover whether disparate treatments exist and to understand the drivers of those biases, such as demographic and societal factors.

In the first datathon challenge we explored the relationship between socio economic aspects that contribute to health equity. For this next challenge we’re building on that analysis to see how climate patterns impact access to healthcare."

Challenge: To predict the duration of time it takes for patients to receive metastatic cancer diagnosis.
